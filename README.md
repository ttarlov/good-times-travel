## Challenges

This project was the final solo project for Module 2 of 4 at Turing School of Software Design. We were given 5 days to build out a fully functional travel website/App that pulled the data from a web server via fetch web API.  The biggest challenge for this project was timing. I was not able to deliver full functionality in the given time. However I decided to continue working on this app. There is still some functionality and testing that needs to be finished.

## Wins
Biggest win of this project was putting together everything I learned in Mod1 and Mod2 together and having a working app in the end. I was able to better understand how data flows into classes and how best to implement fetch api.
